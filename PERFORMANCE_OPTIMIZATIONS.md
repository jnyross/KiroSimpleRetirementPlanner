| 10,000      | 3.03s         | 0.04s          | 72.7x   |

**Average speedup: 63.8x faster**

### Performance Metrics

- **Original simulator**: ~3,300 simulations/second
- **Optimized simulator**: ~240,000 simulations/second
- **Improvement factor**: 72x faster processing

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Vectorized Operations

**Problem**: Original implementation used loops and individual calculations
**Solution**: Implemented NumPy vectorized operations for bulk calculations

```python
# Before: Loop-based approach
for i in range(len(portfolio_values)):
    new_value = portfolio_values[i] * (1 + returns[i]) - withdrawals[i]
    results.append(max(0, new_value))

# After: Vectorized approach
results = np.maximum(0, portfolio_values * (1 + returns) - withdrawals)
```

**Impact**: 127x speedup for array operations

### 2. Pre-computed Historical Data Arrays

**Problem**: Pandas Series lookups were the major bottleneck (130,000 calls taking 0.332s)
**Solution**: Pre-compute NumPy arrays for O(1) access

```python
# Before: Pandas Series lookup for each simulation
equity_return = self.data_manager.equity_returns[year]

# After: Pre-computed NumPy array access
equity_return = self.equity_returns_array[year_index]
```

**Impact**: Eliminated 130,000+ slow Pandas lookups per simulation

### 3. Vectorized Bootstrap Sampling

**Problem**: Individual bootstrap sampling for each simulation
**Solution**: Generate all bootstrap samples at once using vectorized operations

```python
# Before: Individual sampling
for sim in range(num_simulations):
    sampled_years = np.random.choice(available_years, size=num_years)
    # Process one simulation...

# After: Vectorized sampling
year_indices = np.random.choice(
    len(available_years), 
    size=(num_simulations, num_years), 
    replace=True
)
# Process all simulations at once...
```

**Impact**: 1.2x speedup for bootstrap sampling, enables batch processing

### 4. Optimized Tax Calculations

**Problem**: Individual tax calculations for each withdrawal
**Solution**: Vectorized tax calculation using pre-computed brackets

```python
# Vectorized tax calculation for multiple income values
def _vectorized_tax_calculation(self, gross_incomes: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    taxes = np.zeros_like(gross_incomes)
    for lower, upper, rate in self.tax_brackets:
        taxable = np.maximum(0, np.minimum(gross_incomes - lower, upper - lower))
        taxes += taxable * rate
    return taxes
```

**Impact**: Significant reduction in tax calculation overhead

### 5. Batch Processing for Memory Management

**Problem**: Large simulations could consume excessive memory
**Solution**: Process simulations in configurable batches

```python
# Process simulations in batches to manage memory
num_batches = (self.num_simulations + self.batch_size - 1) // self.batch_size
for batch_idx in range(num_batches):
    current_batch_size = min(self.batch_size, remaining_simulations)
    # Process batch...
```

**Impact**: Controlled memory usage, scalable to very large simulation counts

### 6. Vectorized Guard Rails Implementation

**Problem**: Individual guard rail calculations for each simulation
**Solution**: Vectorized guard rail logic using NumPy boolean indexing

```python
# Vectorized guard rails calculation
performance_ratios = current_values / initial_values
factors = np.ones_like(performance_ratios)

# Apply guard rails using boolean masks
severe_mask = performance_ratios < 0.75
factors[severe_mask] = 0.8  # Reduce spending by 20%

lower_mask = (performance_ratios < 0.85) & ~severe_mask
factors[lower_mask] = 0.9  # Reduce spending by 10%
```

**Impact**: Eliminated loops in guard rail calculations

## Memory Management

### Memory Usage Patterns

| Batch Size | Peak Memory | Memory per Simulation |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 500        | 50.3 MB     | 0.65 KB/sim         |
| 1,000      | 50.6 MB     | 0.63 KB/sim         |
| 2,000      | 51.3 MB     | 0.50 KB/sim         |
| 5,000      | 53.2 MB     | 0.47 KB/sim         |

### Memory Optimization Features

1. **Batch Processing**: Limits memory usage regardless of total simulation count
2. **Memory Estimation**: Provides upfront memory usage estimates
3. **Efficient Data Structures**: Uses NumPy arrays instead of Python lists
4. **Garbage Collection**: Proper cleanup between batches

## Parallel Processing

### Implementation

- **Process-based parallelism**: Uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-bound tasks
- **Portfolio-level parallelism**: Distributes different portfolio allocations across cores
- **Automatic scaling**: Adapts to available CPU cores

### Performance Notes

- **Large workloads**: Significant speedup for comprehensive analyses
- **Efficiency**: Varies based on workload size and system configuration

                    use_optimized=True, batch_size=1000, use_parallel=True):
    """Factory function to create appropriate simulator."""
    if use_optimized and OPTIMIZED_AVAILABLE:
        return OptimizedMonteCarloSimulator(...)
    else:
        return MonteCarloSimulator(...)
```

### Backward Compatibility
