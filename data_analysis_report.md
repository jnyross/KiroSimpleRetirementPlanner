# Historical Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The 50/50 equity/bond portfolio achieving the highest success rate is **not an error** but reflects the specific characteristics of UK market data from 1980-2023. This analysis reveals why this allocation performs optimally for retirement planning.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Sharpe Ratio Analysis**
- **50% Equities/50% Bonds**: 0.51 (highest)
- **75% Equities/25% Bonds**: 0.49
- **100% Equities**: 0.46
- **25% Equities/75% Bonds**: 0.47

**The 50/50 allocation has the highest risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio), making it optimal for retirement planning.**

### 2. **Real Return Performance (1980-2023)**
- **Equities**: 6.9% average, 14.8% volatility
- **Bonds**: 2.7% average, 7.8% volatility
- **50/50 Mix**: 4.9% average, 9.7% volatility

### 3. **Critical Periods Affecting Results**

#### **2000s Equity Crash Period**
- **2000-2009**: Equity average only 2.1%
- **Lost Decade**: Bonds (7.6%) significantly outperformed equities
- **Impact**: High equity allocations failed during retirement simulations starting in this period

#### **2022 Bond Crash**
- **2022**: Bonds returned -21.3% (worst year in dataset)
- **2021**: Bonds returned -4.8%
- **Impact**: High bond allocations suffered from recent poor performance

#### **Sequence of Returns Risk**
Early retirement periods with poor equity performance:
- **2000-2009**: 2.1% equity returns (devastating for new retirees)
- **1981**: -12.6% equity crash
- **2008**: -28.9% equity crash

### 4. **Why 50/50 Wins**

1. **Optimal Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Highest Sharpe ratio (0.51)
2. **Volatility Reduction**: 9.7% volatility vs 14.8% for pure equities
3. **Sequence Risk Protection**: Balanced approach survives equity crashes better
4. **Diversification Benefit**: Low correlation (0.213) between UK equities and bonds
5. **Avoiding Extremes**: Escapes both equity crashes and bond crashes

### 5. **Data Quality Assessment**

#### **Strengths:**
- 44 years of consistent data (1980-2023)
- Includes major market events (1987 crash, 2008 crisis, dot-com bubble)
- Covers different economic regimes (high inflation 1980s, low inflation 2010s)

#### **Limitations:**
- **Limited Time Period**: Only 44 years vs. ideal 100+ years
- **Missing Earlier Periods**: No 1970s stagflation, 1960s bull market
- **Recency Bias**: Recent bond crash (2022) may skew results against bonds
- **UK-Specific**: Results may not apply to global portfolios

### 6. **Decade-by-Decade Analysis**

| Decade | Equity Avg | Bond Avg | Inflation Avg |
|--------|------------|----------|---------------|
| 1980s  | 21.2%      | 8.2%     | 7.4%         |
| 1990s  | 14.7%      | 9.2%     | 3.7%         |
| 2000s  | 2.1%       | 7.6%     | 2.2%         |
| 2010s  | 8.6%       | 5.9%     | 2.2%         |
| 2020s  | 6.2%       | -3.7%    | 5.0%         |

**Key Insight**: The 2000s "lost decade" for equities and recent bond crashes create conditions where balanced portfolios outperform.

## Validation Against Finance Theory

### **Supporting Evidence:**
1. **Modern Portfolio Theory**: Optimal portfolios lie on the efficient frontier, often around 50-60% equities
2. **Target Date Funds**: Many use ~50% equity allocation near retirement
3. **Academic Research**: Studies show 50-70% equity allocation optimal for retirement
4. **Risk Parity**: Balanced risk contribution favors mixed allocations

### **Contradicting Evidence:**
1. **Equity Premium**: Long-term equity premium suggests higher equity allocation
2. **Glide Path Theory**: Suggests reducing equity allocation with age
3. **Historical US Data**: Often shows higher equity allocations winning

## Conclusions

### **The 50/50 Result is Plausible Because:**

1. **UK Market Characteristics**: UK equities had a particularly poor 2000s period
2. **Optimal Risk-Adjusted Returns**: 50/50 achieves highest Sharpe ratio
3. **Sequence Risk Protection**: Balanced allocation survives early retirement crashes
4. **Diversification Benefits**: Low equity-bond correlation improves risk-adjusted returns

### **Data Quality Recommendations:**

1. **Extend Historical Period**: Add pre-1980 data if possible
2. **Verify Against Official Sources**: Cross-check with FTSE, Bank of England data
3. **Add Global Diversification**: Consider international equity/bond exposure
4. **Update Bond Data**: Ensure recent bond performance is accurately reflected

### **Final Assessment:**

The 50/50 portfolio success is **mathematically correct** given the UK historical data from 1980-2023. While surprising, it reflects:
- The specific volatility patterns of UK markets
- The importance of sequence of returns risk in retirement planning
- The value of diversification during uncertain periods

**The result is valid but should be interpreted within the context of UK market history and the specific time period analyzed.**
