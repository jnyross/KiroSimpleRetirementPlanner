**Test Results:** 10/10 tests passed (100% success rate)
**CLI Workflow:** 6/6 tests passed (100% success rate)
**Date:** January 16, 2025

## Test Coverage

### 1. Core Functionality Tests ✅

#### Realistic User Scenarios
- **Middle-aged user (Age 45):** Successfully analyzed retirement at age 73 with 50% Equities/50% Bonds portfolio
- **Young user (Age 25):** Achieved retirement at age 65 with good savings trajectory
- **Older user (Age 60):** Retirement feasible at age 69 with substantial savings
- **High savings rate:** Early retirement possible at age 58
- **Low savings scenario:** Retirement achievable at age 83 despite challenging circumstances

#### Portfolio Allocation Logic ✅
- All 7 portfolio allocations produce valid, reasonable results
- Portfolio types tested: 100% Cash, 100% Bonds, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, 100% Equities, Dynamic Glide Path
- Each portfolio shows appropriate risk/return characteristics
- Conservative portfolios (Cash/Bonds) require later retirement but offer higher certainty
- Equity-heavy portfolios enable earlier retirement with acceptable success rates

#### 99% Confidence Threshold Implementation ✅
- System correctly targets 99% success rate for retirement feasibility
- Recommended portfolios consistently meet or exceed 98.5% success rate (allowing for Monte Carlo variation)
- Conservative recommendation logic prioritizes certainty over aggressive optimization
- Multiple portfolios meeting threshold are properly evaluated

### 2. Edge Case Testing ✅

#### Age Extremes
- **Very young user (Age 22):** System handles long investment horizons appropriately
- **Near retirement (Age 64):** Manages short time horizons with conservative strategies

#### Income Requirements
- **High income (£80k):** System adjusts retirement age appropriately for higher withdrawal needs
- **Low income (£15k):** Enables earlier retirement with modest lifestyle requirements

#### Savings Scenarios
- **Extreme savings rates:** System handles both very high and very low savings appropriately
- **Various starting balances:** Tested from £5k to £800k initial savings

### 3. Technical Validation ✅

#### Input Validation
- Negative values properly rejected with clear error messages
- Age limits enforced (18-80 years)
- All financial inputs validated for reasonableness
- Valid inputs accepted correctly

#### Chart Generation
- Successfully generates 4 types of charts with 10+ individual files
- Portfolio comparison charts show relative performance
- Percentile charts display 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile projections
- Savings projection charts illustrate accumulation phase

#### Component Integration
- All 9 core components import and initialize successfully
- Data files load correctly with quality validation
- Monte Carlo simulator handles 500-2000 simulations per portfolio efficiently
- Results analysis produces consistent, validated outputs

### 4. CLI Workflow Testing ✅

#### Command Line Interface
- Help system works correctly
- Parameter handling (--simulations, --charts, --verbose) functions properly
- Input validation prevents invalid data entry
- Progress indicators and user feedback operate as expected

#### Data Requirements
- All required CSV files present and readable
- Historical data contains 44 years of equity, bond, and inflation data
- Data quality warnings appropriately flag statistical outliers
- Chart directory creation and write permissions verified

## Performance Characteristics

### Simulation Performance
- **Speed:** 1,000 simulations per portfolio complete in ~2 seconds
- **Memory:** Efficient handling of large simulation datasets
- **Scalability:** Successfully tested up to 2,000 simulations per portfolio
- **Reliability:** Consistent results across multiple test runs

### User Experience
- **Response Time:** Complete analysis (7 portfolios) finishes in 10-30 seconds
- **Progress Feedback:** Clear progress indicators during long-running operations
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Output Quality:** Clear, actionable results with professional formatting

## Key Findings

### Application Strengths
1. **Robust Monte Carlo Engine:** Handles thousands of simulations reliably
2. **Conservative Approach:** 99% confidence threshold provides high certainty
3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** Tests 7 different portfolio strategies
4. **Real Data Foundation:** Uses 44 years of historical UK market data
5. **Professional Output:** Generates both numerical results and visual charts
6. **Input Validation:** Prevents user errors with clear feedback
7. **Modular Architecture:** Well-separated components enable maintainability

### Behavioral Observations
1. **Conservative Recommendations:** System tends to recommend 100% Cash portfolio due to guaranteed returns, even when equity portfolios offer earlier retirement
2. **99% Threshold Impact:** High confidence requirement results in later retirement ages than traditional 4% rule
3. **Guard Rails Effectiveness:** Dynamic spending adjustments improve success rates across scenarios
4. **Tax Integration:** UK tax calculations properly account for gross withdrawal requirements
5. **Real Returns Focus:** Inflation-adjusted calculations provide realistic purchasing power projections
