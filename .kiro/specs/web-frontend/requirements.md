# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A simple, reliable web frontend for the retirement calculator that allows users to input their financial information through a web form and view results and charts in their browser. The frontend will integrate with the existing command-line retirement simulator, maintaining the same calculation logic while providing an accessible web interface.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the user enters invalid data THEN the system SHALL show inline validation errors without submitting the form
3. WHEN the user enters valid data THEN the system SHALL accept the input and enable the calculation button
4. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs server-side before processing
5. WHEN the user needs help THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips or help text for each input field

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my retirement calculation results displayed clearly on the web page, so that I can understand my retirement options without downloading files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculation completes THEN the system SHALL display results for all 6 portfolio allocations in a clear table format
2. WHEN the results are shown THEN the system SHALL highlight the recommended portfolio allocation that allows earliest retirement with 99% confidence
3. WHEN the results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show retirement age, success rate, and portfolio value for each allocation
4. WHEN the calculation is running THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator or loading state
5. WHEN the results are ready THEN the system SHALL scroll to or highlight the results section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view interactive charts of my retirement projections, so that I can visualize how my portfolio might perform over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculation completes THEN the system SHALL display time series charts showing 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile portfolio values
2. WHEN the charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL show charts for each portfolio allocation or allow switching between them
3. WHEN the user views charts THEN they SHALL be interactive with hover tooltips showing exact values
4. WHEN the charts load THEN they SHALL be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices
5. WHEN the user wants to compare THEN the system SHALL allow viewing multiple portfolio allocations on the same chart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to use the same reliable calculation engine as the command-line tool, so that I get consistent and accurate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web application performs calculations THEN it SHALL use the exact same Monte Carlo simulation logic as the CLI tool
2. WHEN the web application calculates taxes THEN it SHALL use the same UK tax calculation methods
3. WHEN the web application applies guard rails THEN it SHALL use the same guard rails engine and thresholds
4. WHEN the web application processes historical data THEN it SHALL use the same CSV data files and processing logic
5. WHEN the web application runs simulations THEN it SHALL produce identical results to the CLI tool given the same inputs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to be fast and responsive, so that I don't have to wait long for results or deal with timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits their inputs THEN the calculation SHALL complete within 30 seconds for typical scenarios
2. WHEN the calculation is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates
3. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN it SHALL respond immediately to clicks and form inputs
4. WHEN the charts are generated THEN they SHALL render quickly without blocking the user interface
5. WHEN multiple users access the application THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily run the web application locally, so that I can use it on my own computer without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to start the web application THEN it SHALL be launchable with a single command
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically open in the user's default web browser
3. WHEN the user stops the application THEN it SHALL shut down cleanly without leaving processes running
4. WHEN the user runs the application THEN it SHALL use the existing Python environment and dependencies
5. WHEN the application encounters startup errors THEN it SHALL display clear error messages with solutions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to be intuitive and professional-looking, so that I feel confident using it for important financial planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the application THEN it SHALL have a clean, professional design with consistent styling
2. WHEN the user navigates the interface THEN it SHALL be intuitive with clear labels and logical flow
3. WHEN the user views results THEN they SHALL be presented in a well-organized, easy-to-read format
4. WHEN the user accesses the application on mobile THEN it SHALL be fully functional with touch-friendly controls
5. WHEN the user needs to understand results THEN the interface SHALL provide clear explanations and context

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to easily modify my inputs and recalculate, so that I can explore different scenarios quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views results THEN the system SHALL provide an easy way to modify inputs and recalculate
2. WHEN the user changes inputs THEN the system SHALL preserve the previous results until new calculation completes
3. WHEN the user recalculates THEN the system SHALL update both the results table and charts
4. WHEN the user wants to compare scenarios THEN the system SHALL allow saving or comparing multiple calculation results
5. WHEN the user modifies inputs THEN the form SHALL remember the previous values for easy adjustment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to automatically deploy to a free hosting service when I push code to GitHub, so that I can access it from anywhere without manual deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main GitHub branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a deployment to Vercel
2. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the web application SHALL be accessible via a Vercel-provided public URL
3. WHEN the deployment fails THEN Vercel SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain the previous working version
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL work reliably on Vercel's platform with appropriate resource limits
5. WHEN the application is configured THEN it SHALL use Vercel's Python runtime support for seamless deployment

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the retirement calculator from my phone or any device with internet, so that I can check my retirement projections anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the public URL THEN the application SHALL load and function correctly on mobile devices
2. WHEN the user uses the application on mobile THEN all features SHALL work including form input, calculations, and chart viewing
3. WHEN the user accesses the application from different devices THEN it SHALL provide a consistent experience
4. WHEN the user bookmarks the application THEN it SHALL remain accessible at the same URL
5. WHEN the application is accessed over the internet THEN it SHALL load within reasonable time limits despite free hosting constraints
